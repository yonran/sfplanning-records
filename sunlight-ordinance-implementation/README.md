# Sunlight Ordinance Implementation Documents

The Park Shadow Ban
([June 1984](https://webbie1.sfpl.org/multimedia/pdf/elections/June5_1984short.pdf#page=58) Proposition K,
[Planning Code §295](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/san_francisco/latest/sf_planning/0-0-0-21861))
banned new buildings over 40ft tall from shading parks,
except for “insignificant” shadows.
The proposition mandated that the Recreation &amp; Parks Commission and Planning Commission
jointly create an implementation document.
The current implementation document is summarized in an
[overview of the 1989 memo](https://sfrecpark.org/DocumentCenter/View/16889/Item-10-3832-18th-St_Attachment-A_1989-Memo-Overview-060221),
but the document itself is not available on sfplanning.org so here it is:
